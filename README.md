This project was just for fun.

To follow along, you must run the "get_citi_bike_data.ipynb" first in order to download all the citi bike data and create the database. With that, most scripts will not need any of the other summary tables that are created after that one is created.

I think it'll be cool to build a predictive model with this. I suppose it'd be worthwhile to do some EDA on the dataset given and test out a few hypothesises on what would be a good correlative factor.
